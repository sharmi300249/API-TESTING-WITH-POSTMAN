## Project Overview 

### Project: API-TESTING-WITH-POSTMAN



### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create and execute test cases for a REST API using Postman or Newman CLI. The objective is to ensure robust validation of the API by performing thorough testing and asserting status codes and responses.

### Key Activities
API Testing with Postman: Designing and executing comprehensive test cases to validate API endpoints. Ensuring that each API call meets the expected behavior.

Test Case Creation: Developing detailed test cases with assertions to verify status codes and response structures.

Automated Testing with Newman: Utilizing Newman CLI to automate the execution of Postman collections. This enables continuous integration and testing.

Response Validation: Implementing checks to confirm that API responses adhere to the expected formats and data integrity requirements.

Status Code Assertions: Ensuring that each API endpoint returns the correct status codes for various scenarios (e.g., success, error, unauthorized access).

### Technologies Used
Postman: A popular API development and testing tool used to create, share, and execute API requests.
